# -IHC-to-H-E-Image-Translation-Using-Pix2Pix
This project implements a Pix2Pix-style GAN for translating IHC-stained microscopy images into H&amp;E-stained counterparts. Built in PyTorch, it uses an RGB-to-RGB UNet generator and PatchGAN discriminator to handle high-resolution 1024Ã—1024 image-to-image translation.
